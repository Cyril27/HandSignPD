# HandSignPD

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning have enabled the development of increasingly data-driven tools for detecting neuropathologies like Parkinson’s Disease. However, the need for early-stage, non-invasive diagnostic methods has driven the use of handwriting tasks as a promising alternative to clinical data like MRI scans. This study leverages the power of multimodal models to define optimal predictors of Parkinson’s Disease by considering model architecture, data augmentation and hyperparameters tuning. Our approach achieved excellent classification performance, reaching an accuracy of over 99% through the use of intermediate fusion and contrast data augmentation. Furthermore, the capabilities of transfer learning and integration of additional modalities highlights the potential for reliable diagnosis when a holistic understanding of such multi-causal pathologies is performed.
